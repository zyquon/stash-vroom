    <h1>Stash VRoom Development Placeholder</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            This page is only used for development of Stash VRoom. It should never appear in real
            Stash because Stash will render the VRoom react component instead of this page.
        </p>
    </div>
    <script>
        // Redirect to the root ("/") but with any current path put after a #, so /path/to/something becomes /#/path/to/something
        const currentPath = window.location.pathname + window.location.search // + window.location.hash
        const newPath = `/#${currentPath}`
        console.log(`Redirect: ${newPath}`)
        window.location.replace(newPath)
